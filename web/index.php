		<h2>A little about me</h2>
		<p><img src="Images/family.jpg" class="contentImg1" align="left" />
		My name is Loren Miller and I am a Software Engineer at BYU-I. 
		I currently own my own web development company called <a href="http://uprog.com">Universal Programming</a>. 
		I enjoy anything to do with computers and programming which is why I chose to major in Software Engineering.
		<br />
		<br />
		This website will hold the main application and different assignments that I will complete throughout this semester in CS313.
